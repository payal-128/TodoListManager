The ToolListManager project is a comprehensive tool management system designed to help organizations efficiently track, organize, and maintain their tools and equipment. It allows users to create and manage a centralized list of tools with detailed information such as tool ID, category, location, condition, and assigned user. The system supports different user roles, including administrators, managers, and regular users, ensuring secure and role-based access to tool data. ToolListManager simplifies workflows by enabling check-in and check-out processes, logging usage history, and monitoring the condition of each tool. It also generates automated reports and alerts for overdue tools, maintenance schedules, and low inventory levels. By providing accurate real-time data, the project minimizes tool loss, optimizes utilization, and streamlines maintenance and budgeting processes, making it an essential solution for efficient tool management.
